# Legacy Docs

These files are kept for historical context from the pre-triage chatbot and Excel pipeline. Current system docs live in `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, and `docs/specs/`.

Contents (archived):
- `chat_queue_design.md`, `chat_runbook.md`, `chat_migration_plan.md`
- `design_document.md`, `process_overview.md`, `runbook.md`, `roadmap_and_operations.md`
- Templates and references: `customer_service_template.md`, `approval_tracker_template.*`, `onboarding_checklist.md`

Code for these flows now resides under `legacy/` (see `legacy/README.md`). Use this folder only when you need the legacy chatbot/Excel references.
