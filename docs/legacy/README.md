# Legacy Docs

These files are kept for historical context from the pre-triage chatbot and cleaner pipelines. Current system docs live in `DESIGN.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, and `docs/LEGACY.md`.

Contents:
- chat_* docs (queue design/runbook/migration) — all marked "Archived (legacy chatbot)"
- design_document.md (archived)
- customer_service_template.md, roadmap_and_operations.md, etc. used only for legacy chat paths

Use only if you need legacy chatbot references; otherwise follow the triage docs.
